Assignment 5: Vector ADT

Software: Dev-C++
Compiler: GCC

This program is my version of vectors as an ADT using dynamic arrays. Implementing my vector ADT
was very simple as it only required one temporary dynamic array and a couple of for loops to copy
data to the temporary array. I also created a simple interface to test the member functions.
